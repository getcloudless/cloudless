"""
Cloudless is a python library to provide a basic set of easy to use primitive operations that can
work with many different cloud providers.

These primitives are:

- Create a "Network" (also known as VPC, Network, Environment).  e.g. "dev".
- Create a "Service" within that network.  e.g. "apache-public".
- Easily control network connections and firewalls using "Paths".

The goal is to provide an intuitive abstraction that is powerful enough to build
on, so that building other layers on top is easy and anything built on it is
automatically cross cloud.

The main entry point to this module is through the `cloudless.Client` object, and all calls that
interact with a backing cloud provider go through this object.
